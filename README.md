## Welcome to Signsetta!
[Go to The Wiki](https://github.com/spacepumpkin/Signsetta/wiki)

Signsetta is a visuals-heavy app that teaches you basic ASL with lessons that can dynamically be tailored to the user. When a user is not logged in they will be able to use a search bar on the splash page to look up letters of the alphabet and numbers 1-10. Logged in users can view a profile page that is populated by flashcards of signs that they are studying. Logged in users can also see a card index, categories of flashcards, and play a special sign language game called "fingerspelling practice" to test their knowledge of sign language.

Please take a look!
