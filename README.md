Signsetta is a visuals-heavy app that teaches you basic ASL with lessons that can dynamically be tailored to the user. When the user's not logged in, they can do basic things like referencing different signs. Course will be formatted for logged in user based on categories, levels, etc. User can always go back to the previous lessons and see their progress visually.
